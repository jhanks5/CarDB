-I've made a database detailing the operations of a network of car dealerships, you can find out more about each specific entity
and how it relates to the others in the "EntityRelationshipTextFile" Word document.

-I have included screenshots of the Database Diagram from SQL Server, the ER diagram, and the original database model.
This is because the original diagrams were made on a website in which the diagrams are saved as ERDPLUS files.
You can view both ERDPLUS files at https://erdplus.com. Apologies for the inconvenience.

-Each set of queries (insertion, creation, selecting data based on criteria) has been saved as its own file, if you would like
to look at the SQL commands used for each.

-The redundancy file is enclosed.
